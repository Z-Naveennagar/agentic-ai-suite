Guide the user through programming Versal hardware via the Vivado Hardware Manager in Segmented Configuration mode.

## Instructions

1. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/hw-manager-guide.md` for Hardware Manager dialog details and flash programming specifics.

2. Ask the user:
   - Which board they are targeting
   - Whether they need JTAG programming only, or flash (configuration memory) programming
   - Whether they are using a first-generation or second-generation Versal device

3. **Enable Segmented Configuration mode in Hardware Manager** (first-gen devices only):
   In the Vivado Tcl Console before opening Hardware Manager:
   ```tcl
   set_param labtools.enableSegmentedConfigFlow 1
   ```
   This exposes the Segmented Configuration programming dialog for first-generation Versal devices.
   For second-generation devices, Segmented Configuration is always active — no parameter needed.

4. **Connect to the hardware target**:
   - Open Vivado Hardware Manager: **Flow Navigator > Program and Debug > Open Hardware Manager**
   - Click **Open Target > Auto Connect** to discover the JTAG chain
   - The Versal device will appear in the Hardware window

5. **Program the device via JTAG**:
   - Right-click the device in the Hardware window → **Program Device**
   - In the Program Device dialog, the Segmented Configuration-specific fields appear:
     - **Enable segmented configuration mode** checkbox (first-gen devices)
     - **Boot PDI File**: browse to `<design>_boot.pdi`
     - **Boot LTX Probe File**: browse to `<design>_boot.ltx` (if ChipScope cores in boot partition)
     - **PLD PDI File**: browse to `<design>_pld.pdi`
     - **PLD LTX Probe File**: browse to `<design>_pld.ltx` (if ChipScope cores in PLD)
   - Hardware Manager loads Boot and PLD images sequentially

6. **Boot-only programming** (test PS domain without PL):
   - In the Program Device dialog, populate only the Boot PDI field
   - Leave the PLD PDI field empty
   - This enables testing the processing domain independently

7. **PLD-only programming** (for PL Reload — boot PDI already loaded):
   - Populate only the PLD PDI field
   - The boot PDI must already be resident on the device
   - Used for PL Reload scenarios and iterative PL debug

8. **Programming configuration flash memory**:
   - Right-click the device → **Add Configuration Memory Device**
   - Select the flash part for your board (e.g., MT25QU02GCBB for VCK190)
   - Right-click the memory device → **Program Configuration Memory Device**
   - In the dialog, set offsets for both boot and PLD PDIs:
     - **Boot PDI offset**: `0x00000000` (start of flash)
     - **PLD PDI offset**: non-zero value, multiple of flash sector size (64KB = 0x10000)
     - Ensure sufficient room for boot PDI before declaring PLD offset
   - Example: if boot PDI is ~10MB, use PLD offset `0x00A00000` (10MB aligned to 64KB)

9. **ChipScope debugging with Segmented Configuration**:
   - Boot partition ILA/VIO are activated when boot PDI loads → LTX file from boot.pdi
   - PLD partition ILA/VIO are activated when pld PDI loads → LTX file from pld.pdi
   - Refresh hardware after each PDI load to discover new debug cores
