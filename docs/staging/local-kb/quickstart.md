# Quick Start — Deploy the Local RAG Database

The fastest way to stand up the Local RAG documentation database on a
**connected machine** (internet available) — three steps. If you need a
fully air-gapped install using a transfer bundle, use
[RAG Database Setup](core.md) instead.

!!! info "What you'll end up with"
    A local `amd-embedded-doc-search` stack (vector database + embedding model + MCP
    server) running in Docker, exposing a `vivado_doc_search` tool your AI
    assistant can call — with no documentation queries leaving your machine.

## a. Install Docker

Install Docker Desktop (Windows) or Docker Engine + Compose plugin
(Linux): <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/>

Verify it's working:

```bash
docker ps
docker compose version
```

## b. Download and extract the package

Download **one** variant from the
Downloads page (the two variants
differ only by the bundled embedding model), then extract it into a working
folder:

```bash
tar xzf Docs_07162026-<embedding-model>-0.4.2-amd64.tar.gz
```

This unpacks the `amd-embedded-doc-search` CLI, the embedding `models/`, and the
pre-loaded Docker `images/` into the current directory.

## c. Deploy

From the extracted folder:

```bash
./amd-embedded-doc-search doctor              # confirm Docker is ready
./amd-embedded-doc-search configure --start   # generate config and bring the stack up
```

`configure` is interactive — the defaults are fine:

1. **Collection** — the document snapshot to import (name depends on the package build)
2. **Embedding model** — the bundled model
3. **MCP port** — the first free port at or above `8080`

!!! tip "Optional: GPU acceleration"
    If the machine has a supported AMD GPU (ROCm), add `--gpu` to
    `configure` to run the embedding model on the GPU, which speeds up the
    one-time import.

!!! note "First start takes a few minutes"
    On first run the stack imports the documentation snapshot and loads the
    embedding model. Follow progress with `./amd-embedded-doc-search logs --follow`, and
    confirm all containers are healthy with `./amd-embedded-doc-search ps` before
    connecting a client — querying too early can return empty results.

Confirm the stack is up:

```bash
./amd-embedded-doc-search ps
```

## Connect your AI assistant

Note the MCP port (printed at the end of `configure`, and stored in
`~/.config/amd-embedded-doc-search/.env` as `DOCSEARCH_MCP_PORT`, default `8080`). Add
this to your MCP client configuration — for VS Code, create
`.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "amd-embedded-doc-search": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp/doc-search"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `8080` with your actual port if different, then reload the client.
In **Agent mode**, ask a Vivado / Vitis / PDM / ChipScope question and
confirm the assistant calls the `vivado_doc_search` tool.

## Everyday commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./amd-embedded-doc-search ps` | Show container status |
| `./amd-embedded-doc-search logs --follow` | Stream container logs |
| `./amd-embedded-doc-search stop` | Stop containers (data is preserved) |
| `./amd-embedded-doc-search start` | Start the stack again |
| `./amd-embedded-doc-search purge --yes` | Remove all data and config (start over) |

## Where to go next

- **Fully air-gapped install** (transfer bundle, two phases) → [RAG Database Setup](core.md)
- **Use it with a cloud model** (no GPU needed) → [Frontier Model (Cloud)](frontier-model.md)
- **Use it with a local, offline LLM** → [Local LLM (Air-Gapped)](local-llm.md)
